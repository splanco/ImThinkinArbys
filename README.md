# I'm Thinkin' Arbys

I'm Thinkin' Arbys is a small personal project I've created to get more familiar with web development. It's a dating app where users can 
find and connect with eachother, but the catch is that they can only set up mettings at an arbys franchise. 

The idea for this app was inspired by Jacob Christensen.
